## Directives

* deploy a highly-available Elasticsearch (ES) cluster.
* It should be done using Docker and Kubernetes.
* The cluster should be on multiple hosts/worker nodes, rather than just multiple pods/containers.
* The Elasticsearch roles assigned to the each cluster instance should be the same
* Can be deployed on cloud cluster or local machine

## Relevant Topics

* Why deploy the cluster in a specific way, what is your rationale? 
* Which metrics to look out for and why?
* What would the deploy, debug, backup, update/roll-back, maintenance processes be?
